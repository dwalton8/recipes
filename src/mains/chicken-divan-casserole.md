A tasty casserole that is great for using up left over rotisserie chicken and chicken stock.

=== Ingredients

- 2 boneless chicken breasts
- 3 tbsp ghee or butter
- 1 small yellow onion
- 1/2 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 tsp garlic salt
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 10 cranks of cracked black pepper
- 3 cups cauliflower
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 3 cups steamed, chopped broccoli
- 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese

=== Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F
<br>
<br>

2. Fill a pot about halfway with water. Add both breasts of chicken.
<br>
<br>

3. Cook on high and bring to a boil until the chicken is cooked through (165 degrees)
<br>
<br>

4. Saute the onions in butter.
<br>
<br>

5. While that’s cooking, blend up your cauliflower using a food processor or a good blender. Do it for a couple of seconds just until it looks like rice.
<br>
<br>

6. After about two minutes of the onions cooking, add the garlic and spices. When the onions are soft, add the riced cauliflower.
<br>
<br>

7. When the cauliflower is soft, add the chicken broth. Cook, covered for about 10 minutes.
<br>
<br>

8. Add the cream and lemon juice and let simmer uncovered on low for about 10 minutes while it reduces. Mix it a few times throughout so it doesn’t burn to the bottom. Once reduced, add mayo, mix, and turn off the burner.
<br>
<br>

9. Shred the chicken and add half into the cauliflower cream mixture.
<br>
<br>

10. Use the other half to line the bottom of an 8×8 casserole dish. On top of the chicken, layer in the steamed, chopped broccoli.
<br>
<br>

11. Top with the cauliflower cream mixture, then with cheddar cheese.
<br>
<br>

12. Bake for 40 minutes covered with tinfoil, remove the tinfoil in the last 10 minutes.
