=== Steps

1. Combine flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Stir to combine, then add water and olive oil. Mix on low speed until dough comes together into a rough ball, then shut off mixer and let rest for 10 minutes. Continue mixing at medium-low speed until dough forms a smooth, silky ball, about 10 minutes longer. Remove dough hook, form dough into a tight ball, set in the bottom of the mixer bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

2. After rising for 2 hours, divide the dough equally into 2 and form into round tight balls. From here the doigh can rise another 2 hours well covered on the counter before making your pizza, or can be placed in a bowl/container with a bit of oil and left in the fridge for up to 48 hours. If allowing dough to rise in the fridge, take out at least 30 minutes before you're ready to stretch to allow the dough to warm up.

3. Stretch your dough and place on a pizza peel dusted with semolina flour, then add toppings.
