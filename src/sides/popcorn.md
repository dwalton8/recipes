=== Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons neutral oil (clarified butter is best if you have it)
- 1/3 cup high quality popcorn kernels
- 1 tablespoon butter or more to taste (optional)
- 1 tsp flavacol
- Salt to taste (if not using flavacol)

=== Steps

1. Heat the oil in a 4-quart thick-bottomed saucepan on medium high heat.
<br>
<br>

2. Put 3 or 4 popcorn kernels into the oil and wait for them to pop indicating the oil is heated fully.
<br>
<br>

3. When the kernels pop, add the rest of the popcorn kernels and the flavacol in an even layer.
<br>
<br>

4. Cover the pot, remove from heat and count 30 seconds. This method first heats the oil to the right temperature, then waiting 30 seconds brings all of the other kernels to a near-popping temperature so that when they are put back on the heat, they all pop at about the same time. 
<br>
<br>

5. Return the pan to the heat and gently shake the pan by moving it back and forth over the burner. The kernals should start popping shortly and continue shaking the pan until the popping subsides. Add the popcorn to a bowl to serve.
<br>
<br>

6. If you are adding butter, you can easily melt it by placing the butter in the now empty, but hot pan. Then pour over the popcorn and toss to coat
