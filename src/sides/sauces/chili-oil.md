- 1 cinnamon stick
- 5 pods start anise
- 3 tbsp sichuan peppercorns

=== Steps

1. Use a mandoline to slice the garlic and scallions thin and evenly. Even slicing will ensure they cook evenly and don't burn when frying.
<br>
<br>

2. Heat the oil in a pot to 300-350 degrees F, once heated add the garlic chips and fry until lightly browned. The garlic will continue to cook and darken after frying so don't let them get too dark in the oil. Once fried to the desired level, remove the garlic and store on a tray lined with paper towel.
<br>
<br>

3. Repeat step 2 for the shallots, they can be fried darker than the garlic as they don't get bitter when over cooked.
<br>
<br>

4. Let the oil cool down to 200-250 degrees F. Once cooled, add the ginger, cinnamon, star anise, sichuan peppercorns, bay leaves, cardamom, and cloves to the oil. Maintain the oil at 200-250 F and fry for 30-60 minutes.

<br>

5. While the aromatics are frying, ddd the chili flakes to a heat proof bowl large enough for all of the oil. Once the garlic and shallots have cooled, break them up into smaller pieces so they integrate better into the final chili oil.
<br>
<br>

6. Once the aromatics have finished frying, heat the oil back up to 350 F then pour the oil over the chili flakes through a fine enough strainer to catch all the aromatics.
<br>
<br>

7. Add the garlic, shallots, sesame seeds, salt, and msg to the chili oil and stir well.
